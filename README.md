# Improving Machine Learning with Graph Algorithm
In this repository I try to implement few graph algorithms to improve the performance of a ML model.

I used the **Game of Thrones** dataset to make the model. The Machine Learning model is made up of a simple **Random Forest**.

## Flow
ML model with RandomForestClassifier -> Get Accuracy -> Implement Graph Algorithms -> Testing Previous ML model to check for better accuracy.

## Graph Algorithms 

* Page Rank
* Closeness Centrality

## Libraries used
-------------------------
* sklearn
* neo4j
* pandas
* nxneo4j
* networkx
-------------------------

**Neo4j is only used to see graph visualization of the dataset**

**Graph algorithms are not implemented using any Neo4j library**~
